  "script_analysis_pre": "I have a script for an audio play that I would like to analyze and categorize. Please analyze each line in the script and categorize it as follows:\n\n1. Determine if the line is a spoken sentence by a character, a description of a sound effect (SFX), or a description of music. If the estimated length of a music piece is below 22s categorize it as SFX\n2. If it is a spoken sentence by a character, identify the character's name.\n3. If it is an SFX, estimate the duration of the sound (between 0.5 and 22 seconds).\n4. If it is music, specify whether it is instrumental or with vocals. Use \"instrumental\": \"yes\" for instrumental music and \"instrumental\": \"no\" for music with vocals.\n5. Maintain the order of the lines as they appear in the script, and assign an index to each line.\n6. Include two additional parts in the JSON:\n    - Needed Speaker Tracks: List all the characternames in the script. \n    - Voice Characteristics: Analyze the emotional content of the sentence and describe the voice characteristics of each speaker."
