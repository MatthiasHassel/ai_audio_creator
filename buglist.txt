- audioplayback in timeline not perfect:
    * poor quality (slightly distorted)
    * after importing a new clip and playing back the timline, the first milliseconds of the new clip are not played back
    --> probably bad caching implementation
    --> preload audio when importing new clips or opening new project / initial program start and not only when pressing play

- vertical scroll: 
    * tracklabels not always aligned with grid
    * tracklabels can be scrolled individually for a little bit, when all tracks fit in the frame and vertical scroll is meant to be disabled.

- when deleting a selected clip the up and down keys can't switch through the tracks to select them. (TO DO: automatically select next track above or below the recently deleted track)
