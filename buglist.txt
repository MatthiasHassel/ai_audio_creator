- vertical scroll: 
    * tracklabels not always aligned with grid
    * tracklabels can be scrolled individually for a little bit, when all tracks fit in the frame and vertical scroll is meant to be disabled.

- not a bug but a consideration: input text gets cleared after audio generation -> maybe leave it or display the used prompt in the output area?
